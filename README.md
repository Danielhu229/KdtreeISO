# Discrete k-d Tree Hierarchy for Isosurface Extraction

![](./imgs/dragon.jpg)



This repository is the origin implementation of  *Discrete k-d Tree Hierarchy for Isosurface Extraction*. The picture above shows three reconstructed results of stanford dragon using uniform grid, octree and k-d tree under an error threshold of 1e0. 

The triangle counts for those results are shown below. 

| uniform grid | octree | k-d tree |
| ------------ | ------ | -------- |
| 309,962      | 35,836 | 22,608   |

It's a classical test that shows the isosurface extracted from k-d tree obtains almost half the triangles of the one extracted from octree.

Octree-based method is based on works of Schaefer et al. (Manifold dual contouring).

### Project Dependency

* glm 0.9.9
* glew 2.1.0
* glfw 3.2.1

### Build and run OpenGL viewer

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. && make
bin/opengl_viewer [options]
```

After a few seconds, you should be able to see a CSG defined geometry shaded with color and wireframe. Try drag and scroll mouse to view the extraction result.

**Triangle count: 352**

The argument "â€”strucrture" allows you to compare the extraction result of octree and k-d tree.

```bas
bin/opengl_viewer -s oct
```

**Triangle count: 2384**

For more CSG result, edit src/examples/main.cpp and recompile the project
